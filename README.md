HTML5 Showcase
==============

Using AngularJS, D3.js, Three.js, WebRTC, Socket.IO, Node.js, and MongoDB
--------------

HTML5 has extremely powerful features and APIï¿½s. 
A lot of developers the world over are developing very compelling apps using some of these capabilities. 
However, the main power comes from using these capabilities together in a synergistic way. 
The power of client side database, offline, and real-time capabilities combined with scalable vector and 3D graphics allows us to create compelling user experiences. 
The recent crop of MVC frameworks allows us to develop code that is maintainable and testable both on the client as well as the server.
If you combine this HTML5 magnificence with the power and scalability of the cloud (PaaS) you indeed have a revolution at your hands.  
A new software development stack is emerging, which has made JavaScript a full stack language:

- AngularJS Framework for MVC Architecture.
- D3.js for Scalable Vector Graphics and Data Visualization.
- Three.js for 3D Graphics.
- Socket.IO and WebRTC for real-time communication.
- PouchDB for client data management.
- Node.js build scalable network (especially server-side) and cloud applications.
- MongoDB for scalable data management.

 
The HTML5 Showcase is not an app which does anything specific but is demonstration for developers of how to use these features seamlessly. 


**Platforms it can run on:**

- Web App on any Modern Browser
- Windows 8.1 Store App
- Chrome Desktop App
- Android and iOS App using PhoneGap *(WebGL not supported yet)*

Note: I have not used RequireJS in this project because I am also using it as a teaching tool in my classes. My experience is that RequireJS makes it difficult for the students to follow and play with the code.
