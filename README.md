HTML5 Showcase
==============

Using AngularJS, D3.js, Three.js, Socket.IO, Node.js, and MongoDB
--------------

HTML5 has extremely powerful features and API’s. 
A lot of developers the world over are developing very compelling apps using some of these capabilities. 
However, the main power comes from using these capabilities together in a synergistic way. 
The power of client side database, offline, and real-time capabilities combined with scalable vector and 3D graphics allows us to create compelling user experiences. 
The recent crop of MVC frameworks allows us to develop code that is maintainable and testable. 
When you use all these capabilities in a single app you have a revolution in your hands. 
The HTML5 Showcase is not an app which does anything specific but is demonstration for developers of how to use these features together.

Note: I have not used RequireJS in this project because I am also using it as a teaching tool in my classes. My experience is that RequireJS makes it difficult for the students to follow and play with the code.
