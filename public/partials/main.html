  <h3>HTML5 is the Present</h3>
    A lot of people still think that HTML5 is the future. I think that HTML5 is here right now.
    I have put together this small web app to demonstrate the capabilities of HTML5 and what you can do with it.
    In HTML5 is equally comfortable in creating either <a ng-href="#/svg">2D vector graphics</a> or jaw dropping <a ng-href="#/3d">3D graphics</a>.
    It is now even possible to create <a ng-href="#/realtime">real-time communication web apps</a> with Web Sockets.
